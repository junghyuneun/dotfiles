# Snap-it mono

![Snap-it cover image](cover-image.jpg)

A font designed by [Morgane Bartoli](mailto:conatct@morganebartoli.com) and [Corentin Moussard](hello@alune.fr).  
We designed it for the project [Print-it](https://gitlab.com/Alune/print-it), a CSS-print fanzine you print yourself 
using a webpage and a manual, edited by [Objet Papier](https://objetpapier.fr/).

## What's next

We started working on bold and italics, we hope to release it soon. In the meantime feel free to contribute.  

## Specimen

Web specimen available [here](https://objetpapier.fr/snap-it/). We designed Snap-it especialy for our project [Print-it](https://objetpapier.fr/print-it/) 
which titles was set in [Avara](https://raphaelbastide.com/avara/). We designed it to be the perfect fit as an associated body copy font. 
Feel free to go check out the project.

## Software

We wanted to build this font with open-source software, for consistency purpose with the Print-it project. 
The first version of the font was made with [Glyphr Studio](http://www.glyphrstudio.com/). Limitations in Glyphr 
made us go for a professionnal font design software, so further versions were made with [Glyphs App](https://glyphsapp.com).
